Over the last several years, `field noise` has been a lot of things: a Wordpress site; a mix series/podcast; an attempt to launch a [Commons in a box](http://commonsinabox.org/) for sound studies; and most recently a dormant-nearing-dead web domain and [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/fieldnoiseaudio"). It's a really good name for a thingâ€”I've just be able to nail down what that thing is.

I'll still haven't, but I'm okay with that. Over the last half of this year I've been re-imagining a bunch of creative projects and how they might live on- and offline. I know that I'm still really interested in how these things work, and I haven't had a good opportunity to publish them. That's what you see here. I've pulled in old posts from craigeley.com and hopefully got the redirects working okay.
