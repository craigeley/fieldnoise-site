Obviously, this is a blog. But "field noise" is really a catch-all idea for a variety of projects that I've tried (and mostly failed) to put on the web for the last several years. It started as a blog, then it was a [mixtape series / music podcast](https://soundcloud.com/craigeley/sets/field-noise-mixes), and for a while it was a [Commons in a Box](http://commonsinabox.org) site for sound studies scholars. Now it's a blog again. It's good to be back. Pardon the mess as I work on fixing some of the broken links that happened in the migration.
