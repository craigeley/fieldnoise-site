# the project
Field Noise is an idea that I've been working on in some way or another for years. And it's really been just thatâ€”an idea. It's been a personal blog, it's been a mix tape, it's been a Commons in a Box platform.

## the site
This is a [Jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com) running the [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com), with a little help from [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives) and [glynn](https://github.com/dmathieu/glynn). The [favicon is by Erik Vullings for the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/term/radio-tower/24070/).
